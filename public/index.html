            <h1>Black Lives Matter</h1>
            <p>The Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement is a powerful and necessary call for justice, equality, and an end to systemic racism and police brutality against Black communities. Founded in 2013, BLM has grown into a global movement advocating for policy changes, social reform, and greater awareness of racial injustices. It amplifies the voices of those affected by discrimination and challenges institutions to address deep-seated racial disparities. By fostering conversations, organizing protests, and pushing for legislative action, BLM continues to play a vital role in the fight for civil rights, ensuring that Black lives are valued, protected, and respected in all aspects of society.</p>
